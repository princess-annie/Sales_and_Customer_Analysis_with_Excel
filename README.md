## Dataset Overview
The Size of the dataset has over 10000 rows and 15 columns,The goal of this project is to analyze customer purchase patterns to identify
what influences sales performance and retention inorder to boost revenue and

## Data Cleaning
After Importing the dataset;
- Understood the dataset and it's objective

- Added extra columns for analysis e.g: Churn risk, Revenue

## Data Scope
The Analysis Covers:
- 4 Geographic Regions: North America, Europe, Asia, South America
- 4 Product Categories: Electronics, Clothing, Home, Sports

## Key Metrics
* Total Revenue: $110.95M
* Customer Churn Rate: 20.95%
* Average Order Value: $110.00
* Average Time Between Purchases: 47 days

## Visulaizations
The following charts were used to visualize the dataset showed trends and comparison between two values
1. Customer Churn Analysis
* 21% of customers are at high risk of churning 
* 29% are medium risk, totaling 50% of the customer base requiring retention focus
